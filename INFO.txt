Website Setup Information
=========================

To access your website, use these URLs:

1. Homepage: http://localhost:8080/index.php
   OR: http://localhost:8080/

2. Test PHP: http://localhost:8080/test.php

3. Setup: http://localhost:8080/setup.php

4. Admin: http://localhost:8080/admin/login.php

If you get "Not Found" errors:

1. Make sure Apache is running in XAMPP
2. Make sure you're using the correct URL with :8080
3. Try accessing index.php directly: http://localhost:8080/index.php
4. Check if the folder path is correct in XAMPP (should be in htdocs/s3vgroup)
5. Run setup-virtual-host.ps1 to configure Apache virtual host

File structure:
- All files are in: C:\xampp\htdocs\s3vgroup\
- This is correct for XAMPP

If issues persist:
1. Check XAMPP Control Panel - Apache must be running
2. Check Apache error logs in XAMPP
3. Make sure port 8080 is not blocked
